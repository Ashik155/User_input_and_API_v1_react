Steps: 

1. Create an app for this project
2. Initialize github Repos
3. Create proper structure for the project 
    * Index.js will be used for just diffrent setup purposes
    * Component folder containes all the components for the app
    * 2 Components as of now : searchbar and App
    * Search bar is class based componenent as we want to use state.
    * Added some semantic ui styling things....
